# DCOS on Google Compute Engine

This repository contains scripts to configure a DC/OS cluster on Google Compute Engine.

A bootstrap node is required to run the scripts and to bootstrap the DC/OS cluster.

**PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT. YOU MUST MAKE CHANGES FOR THE SCRIPTS TO WORK IN YOUR GCE ENVIRONMENT.**

## Bootstrap node configuration

**YOU MUST CREATE A PROJECT** using the google cloud console. The author created a project called trek-treckr

You can create the bootstrap node using the google cloud console. The author used a n1-standard-1 instance running centos 7 with a 10 GB persistent disk in 
zone europe-west1-c. The bootstrap node must have "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs" in the Identity and API access section. Also enable Block project-wide SSH keys in the SSH Keys section. Create the instance.

After creating the boot instance run the following from the shell
```bash
sudo yum update google-cloud-sdk
sudo yum update
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install python-pip
sudo pip install -U pip
sudo pip install 'apache-libcloud==1.2.1'
sudo pip install 'docker-py==1.9.0'
sudo yum install git-1.8.3.1 ansible-2.1.1.0
```

You need to create the rsa public/private keypairs to allow passwordless logins via SSH to the nodes of the DC/OS cluster. This is required by ansible to create the cluster nodes and install DC/OS on the nodes.

Run the following to generate the keys
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C ajazam
```
**PLEASE REPLACE ajazam** with your username. Do not eneter a password when prompted

Make a backup copy of id_rsa.

Open rsa pub key
```bash
sudo vi ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

shows

```bash
ssh-rsa abcdefghijklmaasnsknsdjfsdfjs;dfj;sdflkjsd ajazam
```
Prefix your username, followed by a colon, to the above line. Also replace ajazam at the end with your username.

```bash
ajazam:ssh-rsa abcdefghijklmaasnsknsdjfsdfjs;dfj;sdflkjsd ajazam
```
save contents of id_rsa.pub. **Please replace the ajazam with your username**. 



Add the rsa public key to your project
```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --metadata-from-file sshKeys=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Disable selinux for docker to work

make the following change to /etc/selinux/config

```bash
SELINUX=disabled
```

reboot host

To install docker add the yum repo

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
EOF
```

install the docker package
```bash
sudo yum install docker-engine-1.11.2
```

Add following changes to /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon --storage-driver=overlay
```

reload systemd

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start docker
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

Verify if docker works

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```


download the dcos-gce scripts
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-gce
```

change directory
```bash
cd dcos-gce
```

Please make appropriate changes to dcos_gce/group_vars/all. You need to review project, subnet, login_name, bootstrap_public_ip & zone

insert following into ~/.ansible.cfg to stop host key checking
```bash
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False

[paramiko_connection]
record_host_keys = False

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

Ensure the IP address for master0 in ./hosts is the next consecutive IP from bootstrap_public_ip.

To create and configure the master nodes run
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts install.yml
```
To create and configure the private nodes run
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts add_agents.yml --extra-vars "start_id=0001 end_id=0002 agent_type=private"
```
start_id=0001 and end_id=0002 specify the range of id's that are appended to the hostname "agent" to create unique agent names. If start_id is not specified then a default of 0001 is used. 
If the end_id is not specified then a default of 0001 is used.

*When specifying start_id or end_id via CLI, the leading zeroes must be dropped for any agent id higher than 7* or ansible will throw a format error.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts add_agents.yml --extra-vars "start_id=0006 end_id=10 agent_type=private"
```
The values for agent_type are either private or public. If an agent_type is not specified then it is assumed agent_type is private.

To create public nodes type
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts add_agents.yml --extra-vars "start_id=0003 end_id=0004 agent_type=public"
```
## Configurable parameters

File './hosts' is an ansible inventory file. Text wrapped by [] represents a group name and individual entries after the group name represent hosts in that group.
The [masters] group contains node names and IP addresses for the master nodes. In the supplied file the host name is master0 and the ip address 10.132.0.3 is assigned to 
master0. **YOU MUST CHANGE** the IP address for master0 for your network. You can create multiple entries e.g. master1, master2 etc. Each node must have a unique IP address.

The [agents] group has one entry. It specifies the names of all the agents one can have in the DC/OS cluster. The value specifies that agent0000 to agent9999, a 
total of 10,000 agents are allowed. This really is an artificial limit because it can easily be changed.

The [bootstrap] group has the name of the bootstrap node.

File './group_vars/all' contains miscellaneous parameters that will change the behaviour of the installation scripts. The parameters are split into two groups. Group 1 parameters must be changed to reflect your environment. Group 2 parameters can optionally be changed to change the behaviour of the scripts.

###Group 1 parameters YOU MUST CHANGE for your environment

```text
project
```
Your project id. Default: trek-trackr

```text
subnet
```
Your network. Default: default

```text
login_name
```

```text
bootstrap_public_ip
```
The bootstrap nodes public IP. Default: 10.132.0.2

```text
zone
```
You may change this to your preferred zone. Default: europe-west1-c


###Group 2 parameters which optionally change the behaviour of the installation scripts

```text
master_boot_disk_size:
```
The size of the master node boot disk. Default 10 GB

```text

```text
agent_boot_disk_size
```
The size of the agent boot disk. Default 10 GB

```text

```text
agent_boot_disk_type
```
The agent boot disk type. Default: pd-standard

```text
agent_instance_type
```
Allows agents to be preemptible. If the value is "MIGRATE" then they are not preemptible. If the value is '"TERMINATE" --preemptible' then the instance is preemptible. Default: "MIGRATE"

```text
agent_type
```
Can specify whether an agent is "public" or "private". Default: "private"

```text
start_id
```
The number appended to the text *agent* is used to define the hostname of the first agent. e.g. agent0001. Intermediate agents between start_id and end_id will be created if required. Default: 0001

```text
end_id
```
The number appended to the text *agent* is used to define the hostname of the last agent. e.g. agent0001. Intermediate agents between start_id and end_id will be created if required. Default: 0001
